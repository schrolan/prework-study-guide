# prework-study-guide

## Description

This is a site that I created to study and learn the basics of coding so I would be prepared going in to the coding bootcamp. I am interested in learning to code, and this was the perfect way to learn and practice coding. This also gives me a permenent resource to go back and study when I want a refresher on the basics. It also gives the abilty to learn from my mistakes, by noting them down and refering to them later. In  this project I learned the very basics of coding and I am excited to learn even more.
